# Buchta ( restored )
## Dynamic Web Framework

### WHAT?! WHY?! Well, lets imagine Buchta is a stone for a second, anyone barely kicks it. What do you think will happen after bun starts to fully support vite.js and all those 100MB fullstack frameworks will start to work on bun? Yes, noone will ever kick the stone again.
What now? If you want to use it, feel free and use it as it is now. I am sorry.

## Get Started

```
bun run buchta init # create project template
bun run buchta serve # start built-in server
```

## Working with testing server
to have better docs readability
```
git clone https://github.com/Fire-The-Fox/buchta.git
cd buchta
bun install
bun add marked svelte
bun run src/example.ts
# open browser and type localhost:4000/
```
